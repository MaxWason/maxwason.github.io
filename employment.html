            <li class="answer">
              I have over 18 million downloads on a set of Minecraft mods of my own creation (for context that is more than double Zelda: Breath Of The Wild’s sales count). I recently led a team in developing an automated testing tool to save a client over $750,000 annually (the team was 4 people total). This trend continues, but the essence is that I work hard to cultivate impressive results with minimal resources. I strive on guaranteeing a ROI.
              I have worked on all major platforms (web, mobile, and pc), have worked internationally and remotely, and have a degree in computer science (magna cum laude). I’ve managed teams ranging from 20 pre-teenagers to 3 professional programmers. I have discovered my own personal style of leadership; reflective, pointed management through compassion and empowerment. I have mentored and fostered the development of those underneath me by knowing how people truly work (from agile to scrum to a deep knowledge of psychology). This has rested upon a solid foundational base of technical knowledge, allowing me to have a mix of soft and hard skills that is uniquely valuable.
              I am deeply responsible and have demonstrated this time and time again. From opening up shop to working remotely with self reported hours I have always lived up to these expectations. I value emotional intelligence, as empathy allows a level of understanding that is absolutely essential to working in any collaborative environment.
              All the above isn’t to say that I have a large ego. Far from it; I value the position of a producer because it is, at the core, about empowering others. Using your skills to ensure that the team gets the most out of their own (and thereby benefiting the project on an unparalleled scale).

              Know that there is a lot that I am omitting for the sake of brevity. For example, I’ve rescued children from whitewater rapids professionally for 2 years, have traveled the world solo for 9 weeks, was the head sous chef at one of the top 100 restaurants in North America, and have been ranked in the top 15 worldwide in a creative problem solving competition. I believe my breadth of experience allows a truly unparalleled perspective that is invaluable to any team. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat more about any of it.
              Please feel free to check out my website for more info. If you are craving even more information, that website has links to my my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts. Finally, don’t feel the need to be a stranger, please reach out and ask me questions if you have any as I am more than happy to help.
